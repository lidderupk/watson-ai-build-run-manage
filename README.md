## 🌟 Overview

Building and managing AI models is now becoming the key competency for application developers and software engineers. Collaborating with data scientists and ML engineers, the application and DevOps teams are gaining skills and becoming active participants for the AI lifecycle management. Powered by AutoAI from Watson AI technology, you can build models with Watson Studio, run models with Watson Machine Learning and measure models with Watson OpenScale.

## 🎓 What you will learn

In this 3-part Watson AI technology series, you will learn:
AI app use case patterns using prediction and optimization
Basics of machine learning and decision optimization
Monitoring AI models for fairness, accuracy, and drift
Automating AI lifecycle management

➡ April 10 - Using prediction and optimization to build apps with Nerav Doshi
-Primer on AI and machine learning use cases
-Create schedules and plans using the prediction and optimization
-Build and deploy app using Python Client API

➡ May 1 - Manage, measure and explain AI models with Eric Martens
-Considerations in deploying models.
-Using a graphical user interface or code, monitor those models for fairness, accuracy, and drift
-Make model explanations available to applications so your users can benefit from enhanced prediction

➡ May 15 - AutoAI deep dive with Jacques Roy
-AutoAI process - automated data processing, model selection, feature engineering and hyper parameter optimization
-Visualize and understand models generated by AutoAI
-Extract and further manipulate code from AutoAI to deploy with your app
